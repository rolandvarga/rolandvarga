Hey I'm Roland, and I love to learn **STUFF**. Whether it's about software, weird art, 'difficult' video games, or a skill I'll forget within a month..just as long as it's interesting!!!

Fun facts:
- I mostly use `Go` & `Python` for work, and I've been experimenting with `Rust` lately
- I used to not like debuggers, then they changed my life and now I love them :bug:
- :books: I got super interested in distributed system design this year, and I spend most of my free time learning more about it
- :hammer: love finding new tools & to build my own; whatever makes my workflow more awesome
- forever VIM user, because it's simply the best :sunglasses: :crown:
